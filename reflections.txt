- How long did you spend working on this project?

Around 2 hours.

- What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

I was figuring out how to find in an array, tried bsearch, but seems like not working as expected. Tried select first then return first. Also found `find` on stackoverflow, but it's not documented in Array, it's in Modules: Enumerable. Not sure what's Modules in Ruby?

- What two additional features did you build? Why?

I added find by customer and by product.

- Where do you still have room to grow?

I need to learn more about Ruby idiomatic way to write code.
